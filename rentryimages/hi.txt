[TOC]

# Introduction 

Clover, Star, CelestialMelody, or number1star was a prominent OSC member for the discord server she (now formerly) owned. Her server had garnered almost 700 members. 
She has recently been outed as a Pedophile.

The first thing that should be noted is the following screenshot:
![this image shows star admitting that none of the screenshots are edited and that she has ERP'ed with a minor.](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/unedited.png){50%:50%}
This image shows that star admits that she has ERP'ed with a minor, and that not a single screenshot is edited.
However, she says that "there is only one real allegation in there," and that "half of the screenshots are taken out of context, and the other half were misunderstandings!"
The only screenshot that I could see being out of context is the following one:
![this image shows a person telling star not to ask 16 year olds to do sexual things, and then star saying "that's fine, don't worry."](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/likely-out-of-context.jpg){50%:50%}
It should be noted that the screenshot of star admitting that she ERP'ed with a minor was with the last person that star had added after she had been exposed. She was likely only saying that "there is only one real allegation in there," and that "half of the screenshots are taken out of context, and the other half were misunderstandings" in an attempt to keep their relationship with said person.

# Initial Callout

## People's Experiences with Star

### v3rtual (part of 1st update batch)
This is v3rtual writing. I'd like to start off with personal experiences i have had with star.
They were nice to me. I see now why this is a terrible thing. They would say various nice things to me, even going so far to say "love you /p" to me. I felt safe around her, and that's exactly what I now suspect her plan was. This niceness was, however, limited.
I have boundaries, like pretty much any other person. They overstepped these multiple times, telling me "shut up," calling a language I was learning "alien language," and asking me about my time on discord before 2019. These are all on my boundary list. I left her server around may 27th because people in the server would not stop overstepping my boundaries, especially the one that i ask people not to tell me to shut up.
After i left her server, i decided not to stay in contact with her on my own, however she tried to stay in contact with me. I obliged. 
The 2nd time that i DM'ed them, they began dumping info about how they wanted to kill theirself because of how stressed they felt. They have since deleted the messages and apologized.
![screenshot showing me asking star not to discuss suicide with me, and her apologizing claiming she has deleted the messages.](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/don't-talk-about-that.jpg){50%:50%}
It is shown that she apologizes, however, she knew she was speaking to a 14 year old when talking about suicide. This strategy was an attempt to get closer to me by me helping comfort her, and it has been tried on me before. I know how to spot it. This is quite obviously a grooming attempt.

Knowing now that she was attempting to do this makes me sick. I feel terrible. The way she likely saw me as just some kid to try and take control of absolutely disgusts me. 
TLDR on this section: Star had attempted to groom one of the writers of this rentry.

### Cotton Cloud Collective (part of 1st update batch)
I will now talk about the Cotton Cloud Collective (bodily 16 years old at time of writing.) They are by far one of the primary targets of this scandal. I am extremely close friends with Mozzie/Finnegan/Tim of the Cotton Cloud Collective, and I have gotten an account from thet about how star affected their entire system.
When they first met star, one of their alters named Trojan had talked to them and helped her with venting and such. Mozzie claims that this is  normal Trojan stuff, and that Trojan is good with that kind of stuff. Over time, Star had begun venting without permission. This likely was an attempt at grooming, as was her venting to me (v3rtual) without permission. It was a ploy to get closer. While Star began venting without permission more and more, Trojan asked Mozzie to deal with it. Mozzie's plan was to "scare her off [so that she'd] stop talking to us," however, this did not help. Star would then begin asking extremely personal questions about the Cotton Cloud Collective's lightbulb alter, whom she had known for just a few days. Eventually, Lightbulb was "head over heels for her." While she dated star, star would guilt trip her and say things along the lines of "i'm a terrible partner, aren't i?" Lightbulb soon told star that star should focus on herself rather than having a relationship and star begged lightbulb not to leave. After this, Lightbulb went into a major depression, even becoming alcoholic. 
This was around the same time Mozzie began becoming active in Starville. Mozzie says that Star would randomly guilt trip thet, saying she was such a horrible person. Mozzie felt so bad for her, that they couldn't even recognize the guilt tripping.
When Mozzie met their (now ex) partner, named Piper, Star manipulated Mozzie into thinking Piper was an EXTREMELY BAD person. Mozzie notes that Piper was a bad person, but not nearly as bad as Star made it out to be. Star banned Piper from Starville Permanently.
Mozzie began getting tired of Star. It "wore [thet] out to have to carry her issues AND [their] own." 
Lightbulb and Star made the decision to adopt a child (intrasystemically, someone inside of the Cotton Cloud Collective) however Star was not a present parent. This put even more stress on lightbulb. It caused so much stress, that Lightbulb and the child Fused.
After a few months, Star fell for the Cotton Cloud Collective's Cabby alter. Star exploited cabby for sex (and keep in mind, the Cotton Cloud Collective is bodily 16, Living in the U.S., making this illegal.) Star even SA'd Cabby "when she said a soft maybe to [star's] requests for sex." 
The following is a screenshot demonstrating this:
![this image shows cabby not accepting star's requests for sex, with star continuing to pursue cabby.](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/sex-request.jpg){50%:50%}
Star forced Cabby to have a child with her. Cabby did not want this, but she went along with it to keep Star happy. Star also met CCC's Microphone alter, and rushed into dating her as well. Cabby, Mic, and Star, became a trio, and they had their child Sunny. However, star was not around, and since Mic had been in a motorcycle accident, Mic had been in the hospital a while, making Cabby the only available parent to Sunny.
Now, What happens next is the straw that broke the camel's back.
Star comes crying to see Cabby, only for Star to be upset over waking up late. The following images show what Cabby responds to that.
![this image shows cabby really flaming star.](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/star-whining2.jpg){50%:50%}
![this one does too.](https://v3rtual.github.io/starevidence/star-whining.jpg){50%:50%}
This was the last time Cabby spoke to Star before she went dormant. Mic supposedly went dormant as well, Sunny being adopted by another alter. 

TLDR for this section: Star vented to an alter of the Cotton Cloud Collective with permission. She overstepped the boundaries of said alter. Alter asks another to deal with it. Said other alter attempts to scare them away from being friends with thet, which doesn't work. Star begins asking very personal questions to a different alter of the Cotton Cloud Collective, while she only knew that alter for a few days. Star and the alter start a romantic relationship. Star manipulates and guilt trips this alter. This alter falls into a depressive state.
The alter that attempted to scare Star away's ex partner was manipulated by Star into thinking that the ex is a terrible person, going so far as to ban said ex.
Star & The alter that is in a relationship with Star decide to adopt a child intrasystemically. Star is a deadbeat parent. The child and the alter fuse. Relationship ends.
Star falls for yet another alter of the CCC, and exploits said alter for sexual intentions. CCC was bodily 16 and in the U.S. at the time of this event. Star forces this alter to have a child with her. Star meets another alter of the CCC and Star and the two alters become a trio, as well as their forced child.
Star was a deadbeat parent. One of  the alters was recently  in a motorcycle  accident. Only one alter was available to the child, which was the alter that Star abused for sexual reasons.
Star soon complains heavily over something extremely minute to the alter that Star raped.  Said alter flames cabby and goes dormant. Other alter in the trio goes dormant as well. Child is adopted by another alter.

### Intergalactic Void Collective (part of 1st update batch)
At the moment, I do not have enough information on what star did to the Intergalactic Void Collective to write about what Star did to them. If anybody has any information they can share, that would be extremely helpful.

### Anonymous Starville Mod (part of 2nd update batch)
Shortly after a member of the server who requested to remain anonymous became a moderator of the Starville server, Star requested that someone host an event for them because they would be busy. The moderator accepted the request and hosted the event, however, at the end of it, Star told the moderator that prn held the event in the wrong place, complaining about extremely minute things as she seems to always do.
This moderator asks a lot of questions; and, Star did not like this. Star would get terribly frustrated at this person for simple questions about things that needed to be done. She would compare this moderator to other moderators and this damaged the mental health of this mod. She would always say things like "you need to focus on your job"  acting as if being a discord moderator is more important than real life, forcing work onto this mod, and misusing tone indicators to make the mod feel like they were in the wrong for having a bad reaction to things that Star was saying. Star would frequently vent to this mod without permission. This mod always felt like Star treated prn the worst. Star's rudeness even got so bad to the point where the mod harmed prnself.

![this image shows star misusing tone indicators and being terrible to this mod.](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/anonmodevidence2.png){50%:50%}
![this image shows star venting to this mod without permission to gain things that Star wants.](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/anonmodevidence3.png){50%:50%}
TLDR for this section: Star is a bitch to their mods.

### Anonymous Ex-Friend of Star (part of 2nd update batch)
This person wished to remain anonymous, and prn is telling this story mostly on the aftermath of the sitiuation.
Before this rentry was released, about a day before, Star and this person were having a simple conversation when Star's mood shifted drastically to talking shit about people. This person immediately took Star's side, because prn was good friends with Star at the time.
Prn asked Star more about it and Star did not want to talk about it any further.
Prn went to dinner, when out of the blue, Star starts telling this person about how "everything is over for her" and that she wants to kill herself.
This person was heavily mentally affected by this, dissasociating in front of prn's father and rushing to the bathroom where prn broke down. Prn called prn's morther in tears over this, thinking prn's best friend was about to end their life, though Star did soon calm down. 
Almost everybody burned bridges with Star once they found out what she did, except for this person. Prn is one for giving second chances, though this rentry did not sit right with prn. At the moment, prn says prn was still in a bit of denial, but prn took a break, unfriending Star, leaving her with this.
![this image shows what the anonymous ex friend left star with.](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/anonfriendevidence2.png){50%:50%}
![part 2 of previous image.](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/anonfriendevidence1.png){50%:50%}
However, this was not the end of it. This person still shared a mutual server with Star, and prn did not want to leave because prn had friends there. Star asked this person if she could fill out some sort of friend application for prn. Prn denied. The following argument ensued:
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg1.png){25%:25%}
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg2.png){25%:25%}
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg3.png){25%:25%}
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg4.png){25%:25%}
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg5.png){25%:25%}
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg6.png){25%:25%}
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg7.png){25%:25%}
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg8.png){25%:25%}
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg9.png){25%:25%}
![](https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/starevidence/arg10.png){25%:25%}

After the argument, this person blocked Star, because Star kept messaging prn as if they were still friends. Star said all this knowing that this person had trauma with friends (likely names censored with yellow & black.) Star talks shit about people who dropped her in these screenshots (names censored with orange, blue, & teal.) Star then told this person that prn is stupid.
Star still messages this person, asking to 'hang out,' and prn continues to deny respectfully. Prn does not believe theat prn can ever be friends with Star anymore. Maybe talking terms, but never friends.

This person comments that saying "fourth time" is unusual. Had Star been exposed for something like this before? 

### Anonymous Ex-Friend (part of 3rd update batch) [in progress]

A user whom I will call Q for the sake of anonymity has reached out to me to tell me prn's experience with Star recently.

# Responding Back

the response rentry: https://rentry.co/startruth

oh boy where do i begin.
also, solarsweetheart didn't contribute very much at all to the document other than initially creating it and bringing the initial situation to my attention. honestly i don't really mind that but i just wanted to clear that up. if you have issues then take them up with me not them
also this is formatted section by section, paragraph by paragraph.  every paragraph in here corresponds to a paragraph in the other one.

## Response to Introduction
I'm not "invalidating the experience actual SA and grooming survivors" by making this document and showing people the truth of what happened, i AM an actual grooming survivor. That is the reason that one of my boundaries says not to ask about my time on discord before 2020. I called Star out because I don't think anybody deserves to go through anything *remotely* close to what I had to.
You say that Star is Swiss and did not know america's age of consent laws, but that does not excuse anything she did. She should have looked. It's a simple google search.
You say that Star was a minor before what happened. ...??? What does that have to do with anything?? Star was still 18 when she did what she did.

Show me where the manipulation in my document is. When and where did I stretch things to an extreme? Also, i love how you say this and then call this a harassment document, as if thatt's not taking it to an extreme. When did i harass anyone? The only time that anything could be nearly construed as harassment is when i contacted star for her side of the story on my own accord.

## Response to section on me
First off, I do not, and have not, used they/them pronouns. Check a profile every once in a while.

Spinning back to my previous grooming experience, yeah. venting without permission is actually exactly the tactic that was used on me. they told me about how their life was terrible and much more to get me to comfort them to build my trust up. I handled it the way i did because of this. this might not seem like a monster manipulating a kid into anything to you, but that is sure how i felt and what i was reminded of when star used the same shit on me that was used on me long ago.

I refused to tell star why she could not join my server for the safety of [the anonymous former starville mod](https://rentry.co/starcallout#anonymous-starville-mod-part-of-2nd-update-batch) who was a moderator in my server at the time of Star's joining. Had i told star why she could not join, Star could have easily went on to harass said moderator. This moderator had sent vents in the server of why she was severely uncomfortable with Star. I didn't block her from joining because of the pedophilic stuff. I did not know about that stuff at the time of her joining my server. I blocked her from joining to protect this moderator.

## Response to section on Cotton Cloud Collective

Star should have *tried* to ask and understand how to deal with adopting a child within the system. She obviously did not try hard enough if she caused lightbulb to become alcoholic and depressive.
"Rape" is not how *I* phrased it. It is how *Mozzie* phrased it to me. That is how it felt to the whole system. Rape. Star forced NSFW RP onto cabby when she responded with a hard maybe at most. Look back at the screenshots, does cabby look comfortable at all?
Also, Star should have checked to make sure age of consent laws of both countries allowed what happened. She should have checked age of consent laws of other countries before doing anything like that to someone who is  legally a minor in their country. If someone in a country where the age of consent is 16 wants to do an ERP with someone in a country where the age of consent is 18, then the ERP should not commence unless both parties are above the higher age of consent. That is not colonialist. That is common sense. 

Star vented to cabby without permission. That's that. Cabby had EVERY right to do that especially with what star was doing to her. You say that it is not Star's fault that they are in these states. Yes it is. Keep in mind that Star actively forced ERP's onto Cabby. You go on to say that Cabby is victim-blaming Star. How's she the victim? Also, yes, this situation is FAR more abusive than star violating that boundary of mine. That doesn't invalidate that she violated one of my boundaries. Nobody should do that at all, period.

The section about piper is something i was not told  about. I did not know what piper did because I was not told what piper did. Maybe star was right for banning her. I don't know nor do I care very much at the moment, and you'll see why when you finish reading.

## Response to the Stan Section

...who's stan?? there was no section on a stan in this rentry at all. also you called black people "poopoo color" how is that okay in any context that's like extremely insensitive

## closing up

oh my god i genuinely dont even care enough to write anymore.
Star, the situation is old news. nobody is still circulating this. everybody's moved on from you. Can't you find anything at all that's better to do than rot on discord all day, doing rp's? If you like it that much then take up a drama club or something. Become a local actor. Do *something, **something*** other than do all this stupid shit that you're doing. Nobody cares anymore. You're beating a dead horse. Move on. If you really changed then go ahead and start a new discord account and don't pull this bullshit again. 
Get a life. We don't care anymore.
