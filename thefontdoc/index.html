                    <p>Hello, I (Nyan), one of the members of the group who have been around a server Font has been in for a while have noticed the repeating behaviors of her. I and everyone else in the group have made this Rentry to call out the actions and how its affecting and making other people uncomfortable. <br> v3rtual here - Fontchan / Fontthingy is a Discord &amp; Twitter user that has not only done problematic things in the past, but also continues to be really weird and uncomfortable to talk to. Today, We are writing a document to put together all the facts of what Fontchan has done in one orderly fashion, in order to be shown to anybody who needs it. <br> Let's begin. </p>
                    <h2 id="the-bubble-fetish">The Bubble Fetish <a class="headerlink" href="#the-bubble-fetish" title="Permanent link"></a>
                    </h2>
                    <p>For starters, let's talk about Fontchan's raging bubble fetish. <br> When me, v3rtual, and a person who is not majorly affiliated with this situation were talking about people we did not like, I brought up my initial suspicion about Fontchan - that she has a bubble fetish that leaks into every single aspect of what she says. <br>

                    <p>Not only this, Nearly every single piece of art that Fontchan posts contains something about somebody trapped in a bubble. She posts this art in server that has numerous people under the age of 18 in it. <br>

                    </p>
                    <p>Initially, When I saw her most widely shared apology document for incidents we'll bring up shortly, where she said that it's a comfort thing, I gave her some benefit of the doubt. I was not personally comfortable with it, so I blocked her, but I didn't attack her for sharing this art. <br> During an interview one of the writers of the document had with font, she shared the following about the bubble stuff being a comfort thing. <br>
                      <a href="https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/font/0CB514F5-8A30-45CE-8490-59E338E5609F.jpg" rel="" target="_blank">

                      </a>
                      <br> She went on to say that it used to be a fetish in 2020, but it stopped sometime in 2021. <br> However, This is false, because of the following screenshot of her saying that it was a fetish, in late 2022. <br>

                      </a>
                      <br>
                      <strong>TLDR: Font has a bubble fetish that infects almost everything she talks about. She posts fetish art in public servers uncensored, and also sends it to people, unsolicited &amp; uncensored.</strong>

                    </h2>
                    <p>When I first saw the tweet in the following screenshot, I realized that Font being a controversial figure might go far deeper than her just posting fetish art in public servers. <br>
                      <a href="https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/font/whyarepeopleforgivingfont.PNG" rel="" target="_blank">

                      </a>
                      <br> This tweet says that font allegedly did some dumb shit in a voice call with numerous minors. <br> After doing a bit of digging, I'd figured out that people claim that she stripped naked on a voice call that contained children, and found apologies (see the <a href="https://rentry.co/fontchanisawierdo#analyzing-her-apologies">Analyzing her Apologies</a> section for more info on these apologies) for this incident in which she allegedly stripped in front of numerous people on a voice call. <br> I'd found a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fbqT8KHLUOeAIAHxmyi3f4QgK-3lwnxN2XdV8asjpAs/edit?usp=sharing" rel="" target="_blank">document titled "An explanation"</a> on her twitter, which outlines that Font had her shirt off because she gets hot very easily, which carried onto her time on Discord. She claims that people only <em>thought</em> she was naked because of her having no shirt on. <br> But then, I dug deeper. <br> I came across two other apologies, one being a <a href="https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/font/Apologizing%20for%20the%20drama.mp4" rel="" target="_blank">YouTube video she uploaded titled "Apologizing for the drama,"</a> and another <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q5HdQPY2i_CdsAU7SvqPcmIgYrHyb07qV_Gom4TRgIo/edit?usp=sharing" rel="" target="_blank">doc titled "a truly sincere apology."</a> I have archived all three of these apologies to prevent them from being taken down. <br> In the YouTube video, she again claims that it was just her having her shirt off due to the aforementioned heat issues. <br> Out of curiosity of what people think of her apology, I opened the comment section to find the following comment staring me in the face. <br>
                      <a href="https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/font/fontsayingthatshewasinfactnaked.PNG" rel="" target="_blank">
                        <img alt="" referrerpolicy="same-origin" src="https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/font/fontsayingthatshewasinfactnaked.PNG" style="width: 40%; height: 40%" title="">
                      </a>
                      <br> Seeing this comment, it seems that Font's mother helped her with this apology, and told her to say that she only had her shirt off, and wasnt fully naked. <br> I have numerous things to say about this comment. <br> First of all, Why is your mom helping you with your apologies? That's highly unusual, and makes it seems like your apologies aren't sincere. They're not, by the way, they're not sincere. <br> Second of all, you said yourself that this was scripted. Another point to say that these apologies aren't sincere. <br> Third of all, It didn't "turn out false." It was a lie. You lied about stripping naked in front of children. <br> Now, looking at "a truly sincere apology," she says that her mother thought she was only shirtless, and not naked. You also say that your mother told you to say that you were only shirtless. Based on this, One can infer that you likely lied to your mother about this in order to keep your phone &amp; computer so that you can continue to rot on Discord and Twitter all day. <br> That's pathetic. <br>
                      <strong>TLDR: Font has stripped naked on VC in front of children, and admitted to doing so.</strong>

                    <p>
                      <em>Before I found out about this alleged VC incident,</em> Nyan noticed an unusual pattern in who Font DMs with her disgusting fetish art. <br> They noticed that Font will only send her fetish art to people that she knows are under the age of 18. <br> To my knowledge, she has sent fetish art to me (v3rtual,) Nyan, 1 other child in the group, and seven other children who are not involved in the writing of this document. The only people in the group that have not been sent this art is someone who has had her blocked before she DM'ed them, and someone who is not a child. <br> After I found out about the VC incident, and thus, the apologies made by Font, I thought that the above information seemed relatively circumstantial. Definitely something worth noting, but nonetheless, circumstantial. <br> However, I dug deeper, and found out that it was certainly not anything circumstantial. <br> Now, Firstly, I'll present the following screenshot of Font asking someone who is 16 years old to draw bubble fetish art of themself in a bubble. <br>
                      <a href="https://v3rtual.github.io/rentryimages/font/ask_bubble.PNG" rel="" target="_blank">

                      </a>
                      <br> This heavily concerned me about what Font was up to, and so it motivated me to dig deeper into the backstory of FontChan. <br> Now, When I read the apology "a truly sincere apology." I realized that it was more than these small weird things. <br> In said document, she says "I’m sorry for dating that 13-year old. I don’t even remember them either (I was likely tricked into it), but now I’ve basically forgotten about them." <br> ...She admits to literally dating a 13 year old. <br> It took me a long while to figure out who this could be referring to, and I narrowed it down to a person named EnidSpartan. <br> I reached out to Enid, who had this to say: <br>

                      <br> Now, From this, I extrapolated that Font dated Enid, but once people found out that she was, y'know, dating a child at her big age, she manipulated Enid into believing that they never actually had a relationship, and cited Enid's bad grammar as a reason as to why he claimed they were dating. <br> However, I realized that this piece of evidence is only semi-solid (though still worth noting) when I got back the interview of Font from one of the document writers. <br>

                      <br> This refers to the previous snippet of "a truly sincere apology" that I quoted earlier. <br> Now, From this, I went out to find a contact for XenoThunder. <br> I spoke to someone who had some evidence against FontChan, asking them if they knew anybody known by that name, because I believed that XenoThunder may be the 13 year old that Font groomed. They told me that they didn't, however they did know someone who might've known XenoThunder, and they got me in contact with this person. <br> This person ended up being the cousin of XenoThunder. <br> They got me in contact with XenoThunder, who then went on to tell me the following: <br>

                      </a>
                      <br> It was then completely confirmed that it was not any form of RP going on. There was no Pokemon RP involved, as Font claims, literally just Font dating a child. <br> It was confirmed that FontChan dated a 13 year old while she was an adult. <br>
                      <strong>TLDR: Fontchan is a pedophile who asks kids to draw fetish art, groomed a kid, and possibly manipulated another child she may have dated into believing they never dated.</strong>

                    <p>V3rtual tried to figure out Fonts schedule of being online by seeing how long they bump a particular server for so he could find out when it was safe for sta to talk in the server without Font interactions, but ona ended up finding out Font is on discord for most of the day on any given day. <br>

                      <br> And it's not just Discord that Font is constantly online. It's also on twitter. Font is constantly retweeting things, like.. A LOT.. 24.5k post for an account made in feb 2022 is kind of concerning, don't you think? that is 54 posts/retweets a MINUTE. she's using almost every second of every minute on twitter.

I will never be shirtless in a video call or online ever again.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I know there's gonna be like a ton of people who won't forgive me, but I'm sure there's a few who that will, right?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>₆Also I'm sorry if there are some things that I did that I haven't brought up. I'm only trying to keep this video focused on the main reason this drama started⁶, so uh yeah. That’s all I have to say.</p></blockquote><p>1 - Please note that Font's mother assisted in the creation of this video.</p><p>2 - The claim of having. “No recollection of the event” is a straight lie within itself, we hear this later on in other “apologies” stating that she admits and certainly DOES recall her actions.</p><p>3 - This Is Guilt Tripping.</p><p>4 - This is a lie that Font has admitted to. Font admitted that her mom told her to write that she was completely naked, and also admits in her second<br> apology that she was completely naked.<br> 5 - Font thinks that we will believe that she didn’t know that stripping naked in front of a bunch of kids would traumatize them.</p><p>6 - Why would Font write an apology not including everything she’s done?

Oh well…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anyways, it’s me, Font, once more. And I’ve come to apologize yet again. You probably know why, but if you aren’t in the know, continue reading.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>₁I’m sorry to the people I stripped naked in front of. I should’ve just put a shirt on or something.¹</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I’m sorry for sending Axinite and Stray the invite for that Bubble RP server. (Don’t even remember doing it either) ₂Honestly, bubbles are a kinda comfort thing for me now, wouldn’t really call it a fetish anymore.² Still, I’ll mostly keep it to myself and people who are fine with it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I’m sorry for abusing my cat. ₃I should have known that it didn’t like it when I was tryna pick it up, and I’ll start teaching myself how to take better care of it.³</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>₄I’m sorry for lying in my first apology video. My mom helped me out with it and didn’t really understand everything (she thought I was shirtless instead of naked).⁴</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I’m sorry for dating that 13-year old. ₅I don’t even remember them either (I was likely tricked into it), but now I’ve basically forgotten about them.⁵</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As for why I haven’t left the internet yet, well…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I have FOMO, or fear of missing out for the non-acronym user on the go. Basically I get pretty anxious when I’m off of discord or social media for a while. Sometimes friends of mine will get sad and ping me in my DMs.<br> I also haven’t left the OSC due to the fact that I still have friends in that community and I still have to do work for a few other people’s shows (PeppinoTheRemixer’s shows for example). But if you’ve still hired me for your show, feel free to fire me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I hope that clears everything up. I’d like it if you were to accept it, if you don’t, that’s fine.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anyways, this is Font, signing off.</p></blockquote><p>1 - This is the second time she admits that she was fully naked.</p><p>2 - This is not true. It is still a fetish. See the “The Bubble Fetish” section of the rentry for more info.</p><p>3 - Font lies by omission in this apology with this statement. People believe that she abused her cat because, during a VC, she was heard walking off, followed by a loud slam, and then the words “stupid cat” from Font.</p><p>4 - Having someone else help Font with an apology immediately makes it seem extremely insincere, especially with the actions she has done.</p><p>5 - The claim of having forgotten about this person is false, as Font remembered their name perfectly during one of the writer’s interviews with her.</p><h3 id="apology-3-google-doc-an-explanation-august-16-2024">Apology 3 - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fbqT8KHLUOeAIAHxmyi3f4QgK-3lwnxN2XdV8asjpAs/edit?usp=sharing" rel="" target="_blank">Google Doc "An Explanation."</a> - August 16, 2024<a class="headerlink" href="#apology-3-google-doc-an-explanation-august-16-2024" title="Permanent link"></a></h3><blockquote><p>₁I guess it’s about time to clear everything up and explain everything in full clarity¹</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So before I joined discord in late 2021 (I was 16 at the time) I mostly didn’t wear a shirt cuz I thought I was gonna get too hot if I had one on all the time</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This carried on to my first year of discord, and yes ₂I was still shirtless even in video chats, and that became a problem when some users thought I was fully naked (I only remember wearing a skirt) and started spreading that around² (I was 17 when that happened)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After that, I began wearing a shirt all the time, however more rumors about me appeared, ₃such as me abusing my cat (I mostly hug it, but I’ve stopped),³ ₄sending links to servers about bubbles (that’s a comfort, I think I sent them on accident)⁴ and ₅dating a minor (I clearly recall being trick rped into it)⁵</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Lately I lost a friend who sided with me, ₆he claimed I was "grooming him" by asking him to write a fanfic of Puyo Puyo characters getting trapped in bubbles, I never meant to groom him and didn't know any better⁶</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>₇This shit still continues to this day and it’s ruined so many friendships for me, even resulting in the break up of the first girl I’ve ever been in an actual relationship with the same day we entered it and also people asking for their OCs they gave me back, and it’s making me so fucking depressed and paranoid that i just want to end it all⁷</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As for why I haven’t left the internet yet, well…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>₈I have fear of missing out aka FOMO.

It is filled with lies.<br> 2 - This is the same excuse that Font’s mother told her to use, which is false. She had already previously admitted to being fully naked in the VC, and backtracks again to this. You can’t unring a bell.<br> 3 - People believe that she abused her cat because, during a VC, she was heard walking off, followed by a loud slam, and then the words “stupid cat” from Font, Not because of her hugging it.<br> 4 - This is not true. See the “The Bubble Fetish” section of the rentry for more info. She also attempts to use two excuses at once here.<br> 5 - There was no RP involved in her relationship with XenoThunder.<br> 6 - This is not just a claim. This is the truth, this is what happened.<br> 7 - Guilt Tripping.<br> 8 - This is copy &amp; pasted from “a truly sincere apology.”</p><h2 id="closing-up-summary">Closing Up // Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#closing-up-summary" title="Permanent link"></a></h2><p>For those of you who decided to not read this entire thing, let me give you a brief overview:<br> Fontchan/Fontthingy is someone with a raging bubble fetish who decided it would be a good idea to send bubble fetish RP servers to random kids. She also dated a 13 year old kid called XenoThunder, and another kid named EnidSpartan. She manipulated Enid into believing they never dated. One day, she decided to strip naked in front of kids on a vc, and then lie about it in her terrible apology by saying that she was only shirtless, and continues to attempt to lie about it to this day. When she admitted she was naked in it to someone, she backtracked and said she was "pressured to do so." Even after such circumstances, she continues to rot on discord and twitter all day every day, sending her awful fetish art to kids.<br> And, to Font, No amount of apology, sincere or not, will get people to like you, and side with you. You dated two children, Enid and Xeno, and continue to ask kids to draw your fetish art. You've stripped naked in front of kids. Please realize your situation, and along with it, realize that the safety of these kids outweighs your supposed FOMO. If you want your friends to stop contacting you, Tell them the truth, tell them that you're leaving discord and such because of this truth, and get off the internet. Along with that, Get a job, and Get a life. You're 19 years old sitting on discord and twitter all day.<br> Please grow and change as a person, Font.</p>
