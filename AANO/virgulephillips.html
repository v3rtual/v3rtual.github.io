    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>Virgule Phillips seems like a mean dude. He's a killer, a felon, a thief, and a liar. You'd think there's a soft core to him to contrast this, and you'd be right, but you'd need to get REAL close to him for him to even consider showing it. And, the chances of getting close to him are slim to none. He actively pushes away people who try to be friends with him. He also seems to have an avoidant attatchment style.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Virgule was a really nice kid. Keyword "was." He'd go to the gym real frequently. One day, when he was 16 years old, he went to the gym, and when he was done working out, he sat in the sauna. Unfortunately for him, the Sauna suddenly exploded due to the extreme heat it was set at. You might consider him lucky to survive the explosion, but there's nothing lucky about what happened to him after. Due to his intense burn wounds, he was shunned by his peers, and considered extremely ugly. Because of this, he decided to really let himself be lonely, and just do whatever the hell he wanted. Now, because of this indulgence in solitude, he resides on the outskirts of society, living a life of crime.</p>
