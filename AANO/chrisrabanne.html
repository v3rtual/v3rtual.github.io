    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>Chris is the type that seems really cold, but really is a kind soul on the inside. He's a very careful individual, trying to think things out before acting. He is very defensive and protectoral of those he is close with, and will not tolerate bullshit.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Chris was one of the popular kids in school, the kind that would get into parties easily. He was well known and well liked. The groups of people he'd associate with included people who would use illegal recreational substances. Through these connections, he figured out how he could get some money off of it. He thought it would be an easy way to get by. Because of this affiliation, Chris became generally desensitized to drugs, really viewing them as something normal. <br> When he became friends with a non-notable Jack Weinstein, he began dealing this person drugs at a low cost, thinking that Jack would be perfectly fine. Jack ended up overdosing and dying due to a quickly-developed addiction, and when Jack Weinstein's parents figured out it was Chris who had dealt their son the drugs, they chased him down and shot him. Chris ended up in the hospital for multiple days. When everybody found out that Chris had caused Jack's death, they lost respect for him. The only people he had were the connections he'd made dealing drugs.</p>
