    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>Winter is generally just a sad person to be around. He always seems either irritable or depressed. He's drunk nearly all the time, and he's real fast to switch up how he's feeling.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>In the past, Winter was a really fun presence, like the life of the party. When he turned 21, the legal drinking age where he lived, he had a friend throw a large party in celebration. He ended up getting totally wasted. When people at the party made a joke that really pissed him off, he decided to go home. He got in his car, still drunk, and tried to drive to his own house, and ended up crashing into a utility pole. He was left in a coma for 22 years, and during that time, all of his friends had given up on his recovery. When he finally woke up, and realised how truly alone he was, he resorted to drinking. Now, he's a chronic alcoholic, using it as an attempt to cope with how he thinks that there is nobody else left in the world for him.</p>
